  "name": "Michigan Department of State Police v. Sitz",
  "facts_of_the_case": "<p>In 1986, the Michigan State Police Department created a sobriety checkpoint program aimed at reducing drunk driving within the state. The program included guidelines governing the location of roadblocks and the amount of publicity to be given to the operation. Before the first roadblock went into effect, Rick Sitz, a licensed Michigan driver, challenged the checkpoints and sought declaratory and injunctive relief. Sitz was victorious in the Michigan lower courts.</p>\n",
  "question": "<p>Did the drunk driving checkpoints violate motorists' privacy protected by the Fourth Amendment?</p>\n",
  "conclusion": "<p>In a 6-to-3 decision, the Court held that the roadblocks did not violate the Fourth Amendment. The Court noted that \"no one can seriously dispute the magnitude of the drunken driving problem or the States' interest in eradicating it.\" The Court then found that \"the weight bearing on the other scale--the measure of the intrusion on motorists stopped briefly at sobriety checkpoints--is slight.\" The Court also found that empirical evidence supported the effectiveness of the program.</p>\n"
