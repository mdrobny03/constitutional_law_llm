{
  "name": "Chimel v. California",
  "facts_of_the_case": "<p>Local police officers went to Chimel's home with a warrant authorizing his arrest for burglary. Upon serving him with the arrest warrant, the officers conducted a comprehensive search of Chimel's residence. The search uncovered a number of items that were later used to convict Chimel. State courts upheld the conviction.</p>\n",
  "question": "<p>Was the warrantless search of Chimel's home constitutionally justified under the Fourth Amendment as \"incident to that arrest?\"</p>\n",
  "conclusion": "<p>In a 6-2 decision, the Court held that the search of Chimel's house was unreasonable under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments. The Court reasoned that searches \"incident to arrest\" are limited to the area within the immediate control of the suspect. While police could reasonably search and seize evidence on or around the arrestee's person, they were prohibited from rummaging through the entire house without a search warrant. The Court emphasized the importance of warrants and probable cause as necessary bulwarks against government abuse.</p>\n<p>Justice Abe Fortas participated in oral argument but retired before the Court rendered its decision.</p>\n"
