  "name": "Wong Sun v. United States",
  "facts_of_the_case": "<p>Police arrested Hom Way for possession of heroin.  While under arrest, Way told police that a man named \u201cBlackie Toy\u201d once sold him an ounce of heroin at his laundry on Leavenworth St.  Later that day, police found a laundry run by James Wah Toy.  Nothing on the record identified Toy as \u201cBlackie Toy\u201d, but police arrested him anyway.  Police then went to Toy\u2019s house where they arrested Johnny Yee and found several tubes containing less than one ounce of heroin. Police also arrested Wong Sun.  Police interrogated the men and wrote statements in English for them to sign.  Both men refused, citing errors in the statements.  At trial in U.S. District Court, Toy and Sun were convicted on federal narcotics charges.  On appeal, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed. </p>\n",
  "question": "<p>(1) Were the petitioners' arrests lawful?</p>\n<p>(2) Were the petitioners' unsigned statements admissible as evidence?</p>\n",
  "conclusion": "<p>No, No.  In a 5-4 decision, Justice William J. Brennan wrote the majority opinion reversing the lower court and remanding for a new trial.  The Supreme Court held that the police did not have probable cause to justify the arrests.  With regard to Toy, the court should exclude all evidence found during the search because they are the \u201cfruits\u201d of an unlawful search.   The unsigned statement was not corroborated, so it gave no basis for conviction.  Sun\u2019s unsigned confession and evidence against him were admissible.</p>\n<p>Justice Tom C. Clark wrote a dissent, stating that the arrests were lawful and there was no reason to grant Sun a new trial.  Justices James M. Harlan, Potter Stewart, and Byron R. White joined in the dissent.</p>\n"
