  "name": "Roth v. United States",
  "facts_of_the_case": "<p>Roth operated a book-selling business in New York and was convicted of mailing obscene circulars and an obscene book in violation of a federal obscenity statute. Roth's case was combined with <em>Alberts v. California</em>, in which a California obscenity law was challenged by Alberts after his similar conviction for selling lewd and obscene books in addition to composing and publishing obscene advertisements for his products.</p>\n",
  "question": "<p>Did either the federal or California's obscenity restrictions, prohibiting the sale or transfer of obscene materials through the mail, impinge upon the freedom of expression as guaranteed by the First Amendment?</p>\n",
  "conclusion": "<p>In a 6-to-3 decision written by Justice William J. Brennan, Jr., the Court held that obscenity was not \"within the area of constitutionally protected speech or press.\" The Court noted that the First Amendment was not intended to protect every utterance or form of expression, such as materials that were \"utterly without redeeming social importance.\" The Court held that the test to determine obscenity was \"whether to the average person, applying contemporary community standards, the dominant theme of the material taken as a whole appeals to prurient interest.\" The Court held that such a definition of obscenity gave sufficient fair warning and satisfied the demands of Due Process. Brennan later reversed his position on this issue in Miller v. California (1973).</p>\n"
