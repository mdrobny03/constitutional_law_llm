  "name": "Near v. Minnesota ex rel. Olson",
  "facts_of_the_case": "<p>In a Minneapolis newspaper called The Saturday Press, Jay Near and Howard Guilford accused local officials of being implicated with gangsters. Minnesota officials sought a permanent injunction against The Saturday Press on the grounds that it violated the Public Nuisance Law because it was malicious, scandalous, and defamatory. The law provided that any person \"engaged in the business\" of regularly publishing or circulating an \"obscene, lewd, and lascivious\" or a \"malicious, scandalous and defamatory\" newspaper or periodical was guilty of a nuisance, and could be enjoined from further committing or maintaining the nuisance. The state supreme court upheld both the temporary injunction and the permanent injunction that eventually issued from the trial court.\u00a0</p>\n",
  "question": "<p>Does the Minnesota \"gag law\" violate the free press provision of the First Amendment?</p>\n",
  "conclusion": "<p>In an opinion authored by Chief Justice Charles Hughes, the Court held that the statute authorizing the injunction was facially unconstitutional, meaning the decision was based on an analysis of the law's general applications, not the specific context of this case. The Court held that the statutory scheme constituted a prior restraint and hence was invalid under the First Amendment. (The majority used the incorporation doctrine to apply the rights granted under the Bill of Rights to the states under the Fourteenth Amendment.) The Court established as a constitutional principle the doctrine that, with some narrow exceptions, the government could not censor or otherwise prohibit a publication in advance, even though the communication might be punishable after publication in a criminal or other proceeding. In some situations, such as when speech is obscene, incites violence, or reveals military secrets, the government might be able to justify a prior restraint.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Justices Butler, Van Devanter, McReynolds, and Sutherland dissented in an opinion written by Justice Butler.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n"
