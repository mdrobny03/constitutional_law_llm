  "name": "West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette",
  "facts_of_the_case": "<p>In 1942, the West Virginia Board of Education required public schools to include salutes to the flag by teachers and students as a mandatory part of school activities. The children in a family of Jehovah's Witnesses refused to perform the salute and were sent home from school for non-compliance. They were also threatened with reform schools used for criminally active children, and their parents faced prosecutions for causing juvenile delinquency.</p>\n",
  "question": "<p>Did the compulsory flag-salute for public schoolchildren violate the First Amendment?</p>\n",
  "conclusion": "<p>In a 6-to-3 decision, the Court overruled its decision in <em>Minersville School District v. Gobitis</em> and held that compelling public schoolchildren to salute the flag was unconstitutional. In an opinion written by Robert Houghwout Jackson, the Court found that the First Amendment cannot enforce a unanimity of opinion on any topic, and national symbols like the flag should not receive a level of deference that trumps constitutional protections. He argued that curtailing or eliminating dissent was an improper and ineffective way of generating unity.</p>\n<p>Justices Black and Douglas concurred to repudiate their earlier opinions in First Amendment decisions.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Justice Frankfurter dissented. He believed the Court was exceeding the scope of the judicial role and was taking on a legislative function in striking down the law.\u00a0</p>\n"
