  "name": "Cantwell v. Connecticut",
  "facts_of_the_case": "<p>Newton Cantwell and his sons, Jehovah's Witnesses, were proselytizing a predominantly Catholic neighborhood in Connecticut. They were travelling door-to-door and approaching people on the street. Two pedestrians reacted angrily to an anti-Catholic message. Cantwell and his sons were arrested and charged with: (1) violation of a Connecticut statute requiring solicitors to obtain a certificate before soliciting funds from the public, and (2) inciting a common-law breach of the peace.</p>\n",
  "question": "<p>Did the Cantwells\u2019 convictions violate the First Amendment?\u00a0</p>\n",
  "conclusion": "<p>In a unanimous decision, the Court held the Cantwells\u2019 actions were protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments. Writing for the Court, Justice Owen Roberts reasoned that while general regulations on solicitation were legitimate, restrictions based on religious grounds were not. Because the statute allowed local officials to determine which causes were religious and which ones were not, it violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The Court also held that while the maintenance of public order was a valid state interest, it could not be used to justify the suppression of \"free communication of views.\" The Cantwells' message, while offensive to many, did not threaten \"bodily harm\" and was protected religious speech.</p>\n"
