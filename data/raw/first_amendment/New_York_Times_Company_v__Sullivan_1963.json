  "name": "New York Times Company v. Sullivan",
  "facts_of_the_case": "<p>During the Civil Rights movement of the 1960s, the <em>New York Times</em> published an ad for contributing donations to defend Martin Luther King, Jr., on perjury charges. The ad contained several minor factual inaccuracies. The city Public Safety Commissioner, L.B. Sullivan, felt that the criticism of his subordinates reflected on him, even though he was not mentioned in the ad. Sullivan sent a written request to the <em>Times</em> to publicly retract the information, as required for a public figure to seek punitive damages in a libel action under Alabama law.\u00a0</p>\n<p>When the <em>Times</em> refused and claimed that they were puzzled by the request, Sullivan filed a libel action against the <em>Times</em> and a group of African American ministers mentioned in the ad. A jury in state court awarded him $500,000 in damages. The state supreme court affirmed and the <em>Times</em> appealed.\u00a0</p>\n",
  "question": "<p>Did Alabama's libel law unconstitutionally infringe on the First Amendment's freedom of speech and freedom of press protections?</p>\n",
  "conclusion": "<p>To sustain a claim of defamation or libel, the First Amendment requires that the plaintiff show that the defendant knew that a statement was false or was reckless in deciding to publish the information without investigating whether it was accurate.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In a unanimous opinion authored by Justice Brennan, the Court ruled for the <em>Times</em>. When a statement concerns a public figure, the Court held, it is not enough to show that it is false for the press to be liable for libel. Instead, the target of the statement must show that it was made with knowledge of or reckless disregard for its falsity. Brennan used the term \"actual malice\" to summarize this standard, although he did not intend the usual meaning of a malicious purpose. In libel law, \u201cmalice\u201d had meant knowledge or gross recklessness rather than intent, since courts found it difficult to imagine that someone would knowingly disseminate false information without a bad intent.\u00a0</p>\n"
