  "name": "National Association for the Advancement of Colored People v. Patterson",
  "facts_of_the_case": "<p>Alabama sought to prevent the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) from conducting further business in the state. After the circuit court issued a restraining order, the state issued a subpoena for various records, including the NAACP's membership lists.\u00a0</p>\n",
  "question": "<p>Did Alabama's requirement violate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment?</p>\n",
  "conclusion": "<p>In an opinion authored by Justice John M. Harlan II, a unanimous Court decided in favor of the petitioners, holding that \"Immunity from state scrutiny of petitioner's membership lists is here so related to the right of petitioner's members to pursue their lawful private interests privately and to associate freely with others in doing so as to come within the protection of the Fourteenth Amendment.\" Further, the Court held that freedom to associate with organizations dedicated to the \"advancement of beliefs and ideas\" is an inseparable part of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Justice Harlan concluded that the state's obtaining the names of the Association's membership would likely interfere with the free association of its members, so the state's interest in obtaining the records was superseded by the constitutional rights of the petitioners.</p>\n"
