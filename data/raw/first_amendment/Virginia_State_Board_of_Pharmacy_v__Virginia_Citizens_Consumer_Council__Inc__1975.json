  "name": "Virginia State Board of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, Inc.",
  "facts_of_the_case": "<p>Acting on behalf of prescription drug consumers, the Virginia Citizens Consumer Council challenged a Virginia statute that declared it unprofessional conduct for licensed pharmacists to advertise their prescription drug prices. On appeal from an adverse ruling by a three-judge District Court panel, the Supreme Court granted the Virginia State Board of Pharmacy review.</p>\n",
  "question": "<p>Is a statutory ban on advertising prescription drug prices by licensed pharmacists a violation of \"commercial speech\" under the First Amendment?</p>\n",
  "conclusion": "<p>Yes. In a 7-to-1 opinion, the Court held that the First Amendment protects willing speakers and willing listeners equally. The Court noted that in cases of commercial speech, such as price advertising, freedom of speech protections apply just as they would to noncommercial speech. Even speech that is sold for profit, or involves financial solicitations, is protected. The Court concluded that although the Virginia State Board of Pharmacy has a legitimate interest in preserving professionalism among its members, it may not do so at the expense of public knowledge about lawful competitive pricing terms.</p>\n"
