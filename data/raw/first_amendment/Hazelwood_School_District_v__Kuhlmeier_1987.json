{
  "name": "Hazelwood School District v. Kuhlmeier",
  "facts_of_the_case": "<p>The Spectrum, the school-sponsored newspaper of Hazelwood East High School, was written and edited by students. In May 1983, Robert E. Reynolds, the school principal, received the pages proofs for the May 13 issue. Reynolds found two of the articles in the issue to be inappropriate, and ordered that the pages on which the articles appeared be withheld from publication. Cathy Kuhlmeier and two other former Hazelwood East students brought the case to court.</p>\n",
  "question": "<p>Did the principal's deletion of the articles violate the students' rights under the First Amendment?</p>\n",
  "conclusion": "<p>No. In a 5-to-3 decision, the Court held that the First Amendment did not require schools to affirmatively promote particular types of student speech. The Court held that schools must be able to set high standards for student speech disseminated under their auspices, and that schools retained the right to refuse to sponsor speech that was \"inconsistent with 'the shared values of a civilized social order.'\" Educators did not offend the First Amendment by exercising editorial control over the content of student speech so long as their actions were \"reasonably related to legitimate pedagogical concerns.\" The actions of principal Reynolds, the Court held, met this test.</p>\n"
