{
  "name": "Miller v. California",
  "facts_of_the_case": "<p>Miller, after conducting a mass mailing campaign to advertise the sale of \"adult\" material, was convicted of violating a California statute prohibiting the distribution of obscene material. Some unwilling recipients of Miller's brochures complained to the police, initiating the legal proceedings.</p>\n",
  "question": "<p>Is the sale and distribution of obscene materials by mail protected under the First Amendment's freedom of speech guarantee?</p>\n",
  "conclusion": "<p>In a 5-to-4 decision, the Court held that obscene materials did not enjoy First Amendment protection. The Court modified the test for obscenity established in <em>Roth v. United States</em> and <em>Memoirs v. Massachusetts</em>, holding that \"[t]he basic guidelines for the trier of fact must be: (a) whether 'the average person, applying contemporary community standards' would find that the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest. . . (b) whether the work depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state law; and (c) whether the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.\" The Court rejected the \"utterly without redeeming social value\" test of the Memoirs decision.</p>\n"
